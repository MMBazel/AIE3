Then, we can calculate a numeric range for the number of pieces.\\n\\n### Assumptions:\\n1. **Type of LEGO Bricks**: We'll assume a mixture of standard 2x4 and 1x2 LEGO bricks for simplicity.\\n2. **Scale of the Model**: We'll use a specific scale to reduce the size of the LEGO model compared to the actual White House (e.g., 1:50 or 1:100).\\n3. **Dimension Clarity**: We'll focus on the exterior dimensions of the White House main building.\\n4. **Detail Level**: We assume a medium level of detail‚Äîenough to be recognizable but not replicating every minute feature.\\n5. **Windows and Doors**: We'll assume some bricks will be substituted with transparent or specialized pieces for windows and doors but will approximate with standard bricks.\\n\\n### Methodology:\\n1. **Determine the Scale**: Choose an appropriate scale for the LEGO model.\\n2. **Calculate the Actual Dimensions**: Gather the dimensions of the actual White House, focusing on the main building.\\n3. **Convert Dimensions to LEGO Units**: Using the chosen scale, convert real-world dimensions to LEGO brick dimensions.\\n4. **Estimate Wall Area**: Calculate the exterior wall area of the White House.\\n5. **Calculate Brick Count per Area**: Determine how many LEGO bricks fit per given wall area (ignoring interior builds for simplicity).\\n6. **Sum Total Bricks**: Estimate the total number of bricks by multiplying the number of bricks per unit area by the total exterior wall area.\\n\\n### Questions to be Answered:\\n1. What are the actual dimensions of the White House's main building (height, width, depth)?\\n2. What scale will be used for the LEGO model?\\n3. How many LEGO bricks fit into an area corresponding to the scaled dimensions of the building?\\n4. What level of detail, and thus the density of blocks and specialized pieces, is appropriate for the model?\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\\n\\n#### 1. Determine the Scale\\nAssume a 1:100 scale.\\n\\n#### 2. Actual Dimensions\\n- **Height**: ~21 meters (approximately 70 feet)\\n- **Width**: ~51 meters (approximately 170 feet) including porticos\\n- **Depth**: ~26 meters (approximately 85 feet)\\n\\n#### 3. Convert Dimensions to LEGO Units\\n1 LEGO brick's height (1 standard unit) corresponds roughly to 1.2 cm.\\n1 LEGO brick's length (2x4) corresponds roughly to 1.6 cm per stud.\\n\\nUsing 1:100 scale:\\n- Scaled Height: 21m / 100 = 0.21m or 21 cm ‚Üí ~18 bricks tall (21 cm / 1.2 cm per brick)\\n- Scaled Width: 51m / 100 = 0.51m or 51 cm ‚Üí ~32 studs wide (51 cm / 1.6 cm per stud)\\n- Scaled Depth: 26m / 100 = 0.26m or 26 cm ‚Üí ~16 studs deep (26 cm / 1.6 cm per stud)\\n\\n#### 4. Estimate Wall Area\\n- Total Height Bricks: 18 bricks\\n- Total Width Studs: 32 studs\\n- Total Depth Studs: 16 studs\\n\\nFront and Back Walls: \\n- Height x Width x 2 = (18 bricks * 32 bricks * 2) = 1,152 square-brick units\\nSide Walls:\\n- Height x Depth x 2 = (18 bricks * 16 bricks * 2) = 576 square-brick units\\nTotal Wall area = 1,152 + 576 = 1,728 square-brick units\\n\\n#### 5. Calculate Brick Count per Area\\nAssuming that each wall area unit (1 brick unit) requires roughly 1 standard brick:\\n\\nTotal Bricks Needed:\\n- Without detailed calculation adjustment: 1,728\\n- Assuming half area can be windows/doors (with more specialized brick size fraction):\\n  - Roughly 1,000 to 1,500 bricks for a detailed model\\n  - Adding interior/exterior detailed design increase range to roughly 2,000 to 3,000 bricks\\n\\n### Numeric Range:\\nPotentially between 2,000 to 3,000 LEGO bricks to build a moderately detailed 1:100 scale model of the White House.\"), type='text')], created_at=1718139822, incomplete_at=None, incomplete_details=None, metadata={}, object='thread.message', role='assistant', run_id='run_vFZUAbkiN4IOUQ1Tsh6rIJzn', status=None, thread_id='thread_VSMYW8ESCVJzoUachtD0jMem')"

        "In the context of the provided notebook segment, the description key-value pair within the `ddg_function` dictionary matters for several key reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Function Documentation**:\n",
        "   - The `description` field helps document the purpose of the `duckduckgo_search` function. This is crucial for anyone reading the code to quickly understand what the function is designed to do, which is to \"Answer non-technical questions.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Clarity and Intention**:\n",
        "   - The `description` provides a clear intention of the function's usage. By stating it answers non-technical questions, it sets the expectation for the type of queries this function is capable of handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Guidance for API Users**:\n",
        "   - When the function is part of an API, the `description` field guides the users (developers or other systems) on how to interact with the function. It informs them about the function's capabilities and appropriate use cases, ensuring they use it correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Enhancing User Experience**:\n",
        "   - For applications or interfaces that use this function, displaying the description can help end-users understand what kind of questions they can ask. This improves user interaction and satisfaction by setting clear boundaries on the function‚Äôs scope.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Contextual Search Queries**:\n",
        "   - Within the parameters section, the `description` key under the `query` property provides an example of how to structure a search query. This is useful for both developers and automated systems to form correct and efficient search queries, improving the relevance and accuracy of search results.\n",
        "\n",
        "By including the `description` key-value pair, the function becomes more user-friendly, easier to understand, and more efficient to use, both for developers and end-users. It adds an essential layer of context that aids in the proper utilization and integration of the function within larger systems or applications."
